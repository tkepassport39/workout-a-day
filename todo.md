# List of TODO's:  
- [ ] get a random exercise after selecting which muscle to workout
- [ ] ask user and wait for user to confrim they have completed workout (Y)
    - Y = move on to the next exercise
- [ ] display a 2nd exercise at random (idea is for each muscle to display about 3 exercises at random)
- [ ] once 3 exercises have been met, ask user to select a small muscle group to work out
- [ ] display about 3 exercises once again for the muscle group
- [ ] ask user and wait for user to confrim they have completed workout (Y)
    - Y = once a Y on the final 3rd exercise, exit to display final goodbye message
- [ ] Now that a big and small workout has been completed -> Congradulate the user for completing their day at the gym

## Improvements
- [ ] user selects big muscle group -> select at random a muscle for the user
    - [ ] same goes for small muscle group
- [ ] ability to add exercises for the muscle group
- [ ] ability to remove exercises for the muscle group
- [ ] add how much weight was used for the exercise -> maybe create a different json with this data
